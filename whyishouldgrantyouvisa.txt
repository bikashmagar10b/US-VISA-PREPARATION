Officer, I believe you should grant me a visa because I am a genuine student with a clear academic and career path. I have been accepted into the cybersecurity program at WSU, which aligns perfectly with my career goal. I have strong ties to Nepal, including my family and my intention to work and address critical cybersecurity challenges there. Importantly, I have sufficient funds for my tuition and living expenses, ensuring that I can focus fully on my studies. I am absolutely committed to complying with all visa regulations and returning to Nepal after completing my degree.
