7) Why Should I grant you a visa?
=> 	Well Officer, I believe you should grant me a visa because I am a genuine student with a clear academic and career path. I have been accepted into the cybersecurity program at WSU, which aligns perfectly with my carrier goal.
	I have strong ties to Nepal including my family and career goal and My intention
of working and address critical cybersecurity challenges in Nepal.
	Importantly, I have sufficient funds for my tuition and living expenses ensuring that I can focus fully on my studies. I am committed to comply with all visa regulations and return back to Nepal after completing my degree.
