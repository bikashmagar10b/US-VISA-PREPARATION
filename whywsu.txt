3) Why do you want to study in Wright State University?
=>   Officer, I chose to study at Wright State University for its NSA-designated cybersecurity program, which emphasizes industry standards and frameworks like NIST and ISO 27001. This program will equip me to address global cybersecurity challenges while helping to strengthen Nepal's security infrastructure. The university's welcoming community, climate, and the Nepalese Student Association will help me stay connected to my culture. Additionally, the affordability of Wright State University will allow me to focus on my studies without financial strain. With all these factors, the expertise I gain at Wright State University will empower me to implement global security frameworks and contribute to a safer digital future back in Nepal

Officer, Of all the universities I researched, Wright State stood out because of its strong emphasis on hands-on learning and its connections with the NSA, which provide internship programs and research opportunities that will better prepare me to work at the Cyber Bureau back in Nepal. I wanted a degree that truly prepares me for a career in cybersecurity, and Wright State offers that practical experience. Additionally, I was looking for a university with excellent community support. During my research, I came across the Nepalese Student Association on Wright State University's Facebook page and reached out to them. After thoroughly researching the university, its community, and Ohioâ€™s climate, which I find more suitable compared to some other states, I strongly believe this will be the best place for me.
