3) Why do you want to study in Wright State University?
=>    Officer, Of all the universities I researched, Wright State stood out because of its strong emphasis on hands-on learning and its connections with the NSA, which provide internship programs and research opportunities that will better prepare me to work at the Cyber Bureau back in Nepal. I wanted a degree that truly prepares me for a career in cybersecurity, and Wright State offers that practical experience. Additionally, I was looking for a university with excellent community support. During my research, I came across the Nepalese Student Association on Wright State University's Facebook page and reached out to them. After thoroughly researching the university, its community, and Ohioâ€™s climate,  I find more suitable compared to some other states, I strongly believe this will be the best place for me.
