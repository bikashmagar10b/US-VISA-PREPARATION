5) Why are your long term Goals?
=> 	 My long-term goal is to become a cybersecurity professional specializing in network and system security. After completing my bachelor's degree in the U.S., I plan to return to Nepal and work for my target organization, the Cyber Bureau of Nepal. I want to apply the advanced security frameworks and knowledge I gain in the U.S. to strengthen Nepal's cybersecurity infrastructure. Additionally, I aim to share my expertise as a professor in local institutions to raise awareness about cybersecurity. Building upon years of experience, I envision starting my own secure development platform to provide affordable and reliable security solutions for individuals and businesses, ensuring digital safety while contributing to Nepal's growing tech ecosystem.
