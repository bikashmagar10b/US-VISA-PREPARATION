5) Why are your long term Goals?
=> 	My main goal is to become a cybersecurity specialist. After I finish my degree in the U.S., I'm heading straight back to Nepal. I want to work at the Cyber Bureau, using everything I've learned to really strengthen our cybersecurity. Plus, I'd love to teach cybersecurity here, and down the line, start my own secure development platform,I have plans in my mind. That way, I can help build up our tech ecosystem and keep everyone safe online.
