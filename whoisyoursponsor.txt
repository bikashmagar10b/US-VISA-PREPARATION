2) How do you fund for your education?
=> My education will be fully funded by my parents.

=>  My father owns a travel agency, Naturestride Mountain Adventure it has been established for more than 15 years, having an annual income of approximately $18,000. My mother co-owns a Dhaka making business with Ganesh Oja, earning around $12,000 per year. Additionally, our family generates $7,000 annually from house rent and  leasing land for poultry farming.  This funding will cover my tution fees and living expenses throughout my time at Wright state University.
