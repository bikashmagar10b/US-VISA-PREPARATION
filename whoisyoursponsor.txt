2) How do you fund for your education?
=> My education will be fully funded by my parents.

=>  My father owns a travel agency, Naturestride Mountain Adventure it has been established for more than 12 years, having an annual income of approximately $18,000. My mother co-owns a Dhaka making business with partnership to Ganesh Oja [it's basically the supplier and producer of dhaka clothes all over Nepal and Some other countries], from which she earns around $12,000 per year. Additionally, our family generates $7,000 annually from house rent and  leasing land for poultry farming.  This funding will cover my tution fees and living expenses throughout my time at Wright state University.
