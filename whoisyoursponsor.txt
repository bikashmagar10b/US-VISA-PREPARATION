=> My education will be fully funded by my parents.

=> My Parents will be funding my education through multiple sources. My father owns a travel agency, Naturestride Mountain Adventure, with an annual income of approximately $18,000. My mother co-owns a Dhaka making business with Ganesh Oja, earning around $12,000 per year. Additionally, our family generates $4,000 annually from leasing land for poultry farming and vegetation. We also have a dedicated education fund of $13,000 specifically allocated for my studies.
