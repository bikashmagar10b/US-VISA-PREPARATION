1) Why do you want to study in the US?	
=>	Officer, I want to study in the US because it has a strong leadership role in cybersecurity innovations and robust security frameworks. Given Nepal's recent high-profile cyberattacks like the Parallax cyber ghost attacks, which targeted 58 government websites, and the bank SWIFT hacks, I believe that learning from the best will equip me with the expertise needed to develop a strong cybersecurity strategy for Nepal. Studying in the US will not only help me address Nepal's cybersecurity challenges but also provide me with a global perspective. This will allow me to understand diverse cyberthreats and mitigation approaches, and implement best practices from around the world when I return to Nepal to create a more secure digital infrastructure.
