1) Why do you want to study in U.S?
=>  Officer, I'm really keen to study in the U.S. because it's at the forefront of cybersecurity innovation, and they have such strong security frameworks. Lately, Nepal's been hit with some serious cyberattacks, like the Parallax Cyber Ghost attacks on those 58 government websites, and the NIC Bank SWIFT hacks. These incidents really show us how urgently we need stronger cybersecurity. Studying in the U.S. will give me the advanced knowledge and hands-on experience I need to build a solid cybersecurity strategy for Nepal. Plus, being in the U.S. will give me a global perspective, so I can understand different cyber threats and how to deal with them. That way, when I go back home, I can bring and use the best cybersecurity practices that are used all over the world.
