=>    Without a doubt, the U.S. is the world leader in cybersecurity. It has got institutions like the NSA, the FBI, and all those top tech companies pushing the field forward.

My driving passion is to gain deep, hands-on expertise and dedicate myself to strengthening Nepal's cybersecurity, U.S is my clear and obvious choice.
