6) Why not other countries?
=> 	As far as I know, U.S particularly leads in the security field with organizations like NSA, FBI and other top tech companies. I believe other countries may offer good education, but they often lack the depth of resources, research opportunities and industry partnership that U.S universities provides. 
	For my specific goals, the U.S is the ideal place to gain the knowledge, skills and global network I need to succeed in contributing Nepal's cybersecurity development.

There is not doubt that The U.S. is a global leader in cybersecurity, with institutions like the NSA, FBI, and top tech companies driving advancements in this field. While other countries offers quality education, they often lack the same depth of resource and strong industry partnerships that U.S. universities provide. For my career goals—gaining hands-on experience and contributing to Nepal’s cybersecurity development—the U.S. is the ideal place to acquire the expertise, skills, and global network necessary for success.

Without a doubt, the U.S. is the world leader in cybersecurity. It has got institutions like the NSA, the FBI, and all those top tech companies pushing the field forward. Now, other countries definitely offer good education, but they just don't have the same level of resources or those strong industry connections that U.S. universities have. My driving passion is to gain deep, hands-on expertise and dedicate myself to strengthening Nepal's cybersecurity, U.S will be my obvious reason.
